        <div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
          <p>Hey there, fellow humans and curious robots! I go by the name Wenhao Yang, proudly identified as a Ph.D. candidate (since 2019 - I know, sounds like forever!) in the <a href="https://www.rit.edu/engineering/ise">Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE)</a> at <a href="https://www.rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)</a>, under the guidance of the <a href="https://www.willyunbozhang.com/">Prof. Yunbo Zhang</a>. Before I got tangled up in this wild Ph.D. adventure, I earned my Master's degree in 2019 at <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/">The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>, where I had the privilege of being mentored by <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/kai-tang">Prof. Kai Tang</a>. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree (2014-2018) at the esteemed <a href="http://nuaa.edu.cn/">Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)</a>, graduating with Magna Cum Laude Honors.</p>

          <p>In my scholarly pursuits, I am particularly passionate about harnessing the power of Extended Reality (XR) prototyping systems to tackle real-world challenges in manufacturing and robotics, with a strong emphasis on robot programming and human-robot collaboration. My research vision is deeply rooted in advancing the principles of Industry 4.0 and embracing the concept of smart manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Beyond my academic endeavors, I cherish the art of photography, the adrenaline rush of snowboarding, the joy of vlogging, the soul-stirring melodies of rock & roll, and the magic of playing the guitar.</p>

          <p>As I set my sights on the horizons of possibility, I eagerly embrace the prospects of both academia and the bustling industry job market. I am driven to collaborate, innovate, and propel transformative advancements in the dynamic realms of Human-Robot Interaction and Augmented Reality.</p>
