    abstract = "{Augmented Reality (AR) enhances the user's perception of the real environment by superimposing virtual images generated by computers. These virtual images provide additional visual information that complements the real-world view. AR systems are rapidly gaining popularity in various manufacturing fields such as training, maintenance, assembly, and robot programming. In some AR applications, it is crucial for the invisible virtual environment to be precisely aligned with the physical environment to ensure that human users can accurately perceive the virtual augmentation in conjunction with their real surroundings. The process of achieving this accurate alignment is known as calibration. During some robotics applications using AR, we observed instances of misalignment in the visual representation within the designated workspace. This misalignment can potentially impact the accuracy of the robot's operations during the task. Based on previous research on AR-assisted robot programming systems, this work investigates the sources of misalignment errors and presents a simple and efficient calibration procedure to reduce the misalignment accuracy in general video see-through AR systems. To accurately superimpose virtual information onto the real environment, it is necessary to identify the sources and propagation of errors. In this work, we outline the linear transformation and projection of each point from the virtual world space to the virtual screen coordinates. An offline calibration method is introduced to determine the offset matrix from the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) to the camera, and experiments are conducted to validate the improvement achieved through the calibration process.}",
